## Question 1

Write the game "Wheel of Fortune" in Python. For those of you who are not familiar with the game show, you can read more about it on wikipedia.

Below are the requirements:
- Allow a user to enter their own puzzle
- Have a used letter board
- Have a wheel that provides a random dollar amount from $500 to $5000.
- Allow 3 players to play and take turns
- Keep track of the 3 players' scores
- Player 1 will start the game. He/she will spin the wheel.
- Player 1 will call a letter and if there is a letter, fill in the blanks, add the letter in the used letter board, and give player 1 the money they landed on times the number of letters in the game. If the letter is not in puzzle, the next player will play.
- For simplicity, all letters can earn money (unlike in the real show, where a vowel costs $250).

Bonus:
- (+10) Write an AI (computer player) that plays relatively intelligently.
- (+10) Include a bankrupt space and a lose a turn space on the wheel.
- (+10) Allow a user to solve the puzzle at any time.
- (+10) Allow a user to buy a vowel for $250 and restrict a user from calling a vowel if he/she decided to spin the wheel.
